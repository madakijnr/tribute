                    “A man who calls his kinsmen to a feast does not do so to save them from starving. 
                    They all have food in their own homes. When we gather together in the moonlit village ground it is not because of the moon. 
                    Every man can see it in his own compound. We come together because it is good for kinsmen to do so.”
